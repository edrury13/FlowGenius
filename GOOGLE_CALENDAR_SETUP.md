## OAuth Setup (For Developers)

### Google Cloud Console Setup

   - Create a new project or select existing one

2. **Enable APIs**:
   - Enable "Gmail API"
   - Enable "Google Calendar API"

3. **Create OAuth Credentials**:
   - Go to "Credentials" â†’ "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Desktop application"
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback` (development)
     - `https://flowgenius.app/auth/google/callback` (production)

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### Development Setup

The app includes demo credentials for testing, but for production use:

1. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1015492699121-xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-xxxxx
   ```

2. **Update Redirect URI**:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
   - Production: Your app's callback URL

## Usage Guide

### Initial Connection

1. **First Time Setup**:
   ```
   ðŸ“… Click "Gmail" button â†’ "Connect Google Calendar"
   â†’ Follow OAuth â†’ Automatic sync starts
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Browser opens with Google OAuth
   - Grant permissions for Calendar and Gmail
   - Return to FlowGenius for automatic sync

### Syncing Events

1. **Automatic Sync** (Recommended):
   - Happens automatically after connection
   - Downloads your Google Calendar events
   - Uploads your FlowGenius events

2. **Manual Sync**:
   - Use "ðŸ”„ Sync with Google Calendar" button
   - Useful for refreshing data
   - Safe to run multiple times

3. **Email Import**:
   - Use "ðŸ“§ Import from Gmail Emails"
   - Scans recent emails for events
   - Creates calendar entries automatically

### Event Management

1. **Event Sources**:
   - `google_calendar`: Downloaded from Google Calendar
   - `gmail_email`: Extracted from Gmail emails
   - `local`: Created directly in FlowGenius

2. **Duplicate Handling**:
   - Events are deduplicated by title, date, and time
   - Safe to sync multiple times
   - Source tracking prevents conflicts

## Supported Email Patterns

The Gmail email parser recognizes these patterns:

### Date/Time Patterns
- `"tomorrow at 2 PM"`
- `"Monday at 10:30 AM"`
- `"March 15th at 9:00 AM"`
- `"Friday at 3 PM"`

### Event Types

### Example Email Recognition
```
Subject: "Team Meeting Tomorrow"
Body: "We have a team meeting tomorrow at 2:00 PM in Conference Room A"
â†’ Creates: "Team Meeting" event for tomorrow at 2:00 PM
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
