# Location Selection Feature

## Overview
Location suggestions in the smart scheduling feature are now fully interactive. When you click on a suggested location, it automatically gets added to the event.

## How It Works

### 1. Create an Event
- Click "Add Event" or the + button
- Enter an event title (e.g., "Team lunch", "Coffee meeting", "Dinner with friends")

### 2. View Smart Suggestions
- The AI will suggest appropriate time slots
- Each time slot displays 2-3 relevant location suggestions as chips

### 3. Select a Location
- **Click any location chip** to add it to the event
- The location is automatically populated in the location field
- A green success message appears: "Location added to event!"
- The location chip has a hover effect to indicate it's clickable

### 4. Location is Added
- The selected location appears in the location field
- You can still edit or change it manually if needed
- If it's a structured location, you'll see a "View on Google Maps" link

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover Effect**: Location chips change color when you hover over them
- **Tooltip**: "Click to add this location to the event"
- **Success Alert**: Green confirmation message when location is added
- **Auto-fill**: Location field is automatically populated

### Workflow Example
1. Type: "Lunch meeting with client"
2. AI suggests: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
3. Location chips show: "The French Laundry", "Chez Panisse", "Sweetgreen"
4. Click "Chez Panisse"
5. Location field fills with: "1517 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA"
6. Green alert shows: "Location added to event!"

## Benefits
