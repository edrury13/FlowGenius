## üéØ Smart Scheduling Features

### **Event Classification**
- **Business Events**: Meetings, calls, presentations, client work
  - Automatically suggests 9 AM - 5 PM slots on weekdays
- **Hobby Events**: Sports, music, gaming, creative activities  
  - Suggests evening (6-10 PM) and weekend slots
- **Personal Events**: Appointments, errands, family time
  - Flexible timing suggestions

- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows how confident the AI is in its classification

### **Fallback System**
- **Local Classification**: Works without internet using keyword matching
- **Reliability**: Always provides suggestions even if OpenAI API is down
- **Cost Control**: Uses local classification when API isn't available

## üß™ How to Test the Feature

### 1. **Start the Application**
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. **Create Test Events**
Click on any calendar day to open the new event modal, then try these examples:

- **Title**: "Team Meeting"
- **Description**: "Weekly standup with the development team"
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Classification: "Business" (70-80% confident)
  - Suggested times: 9 AM - 5 PM on weekdays

#### **Hobby Event Test**
- **Title**: "Guitar Practice"
- **Description**: "Practice new songs for the weekend gig"

1. Ensure selected date isn't in the past
2. Check for too many existing events causing conflicts
3. Try different event types (business vs hobby)
