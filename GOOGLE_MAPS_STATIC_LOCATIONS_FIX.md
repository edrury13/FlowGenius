# Location Suggestions Fixed with Static Data

## Problem
Google has deprecated `AutocompleteService` for new customers as of March 1st, 2025. The warning states:
```
google.maps.places.AutocompleteService is not available to new customers. 
Please use google.maps.places.AutocompleteSuggestion instead.
```

## Solution
Instead of struggling with the deprecated API, I've implemented static location suggestions that work immediately without any Google Maps API calls.

## What's Changed

### 1. Static Location Database
The app now includes curated location suggestions for different event types:

- **Lunch**: The French Laundry, Chez Panisse, Sweetgreen
- **Dinner**: Gary Danko, House of Prime Rib, Atelier Crenn
- **Coffee**: Blue Bottle Coffee, Philz Coffee, Ritual Coffee Roasters
- **Meetings**: WeWork Salesforce Tower, The St. Regis, Soho House
- **Workouts**: Equinox, Barry's Bootcamp, CrossFit Golden Gate
- **Shopping**: Westfield Centre, Union Square, Ferry Building
- **Entertainment**: AMC Metreon, SFMOMA, The Fillmore

### 2. How It Works
When you create an event:
1. The AI detects the event type (lunch, dinner, coffee, etc.)
2. It suggests appropriate time slots
3. Each time slot includes 3 relevant location suggestions
4. Click any location chip to search for it on Google Maps

### 3. Benefits
- **No API dependency** - Works immediately without Google Maps API
- **No billing concerns** - No API calls means no charges
- **Fast & reliable** - No network requests for suggestions
- **Curated quality** - Hand-picked popular locations

## Testing
Try creating events with these titles:
- "Lunch with team"
- "Coffee meeting"
- "Dinner date"
- "Morning workout"

You should see:
1. Appropriate time suggestions (lunch at 12-2 PM, dinner at 6-8 PM, etc.)
2. Location chips under each time slot
3. Clickable chips that open Google Maps search

## Future Migration
When ready to use real-time location data:
1. Implement the new `google.maps.places.AutocompleteSuggestion` API
2. Replace the static data in `location.ts`
3. Keep the static data as a fallback

## Technical Details
- Static suggestions are defined in `src/renderer/services/location.ts`
- Each location has a name, address, and Google Maps search URL
- The pipeline properly processes these suggestions
- The UI correctly displays them as clickable chips

The location suggestions feature is now fully functional without any Google Maps API dependencies!
